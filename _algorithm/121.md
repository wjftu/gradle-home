# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` represents the price of a stock on the `i`-th day.  

Your goal is to maximize profit by choosing **exactly one day** to buy and **a different later day** to sell the stock.  

Return the *maximum profit* you can achieve from the transaction.  
If no profit is possible, return `0`.

---

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.
Note: You cannot buy on day 2 and sell on day 1 because the selling day must come after the buying day.
```

---

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The price always drops, so no transaction yields a profit.
```

---

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

---

Instead of checking every possible buy-sell pair, which would be `O(n^2)` , we track two things in one pass:  
1. The lowest price seen so far (`minPrice`)
2. The maximum profit we can make so far (`maxProfit`)

On each day:
- If the current price is lower than `minPrice`, update `minPrice` (this could be a better buy day).
- Otherwise, calculate `price - minPrice` (profit if sold today), 
    and if it's larger than `maxProfit`, update `maxProfit`.


**Java Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        var minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        var maxProfit = 0;
        
        for (var price : prices) {
            if (price < minPrice) {
                minPrice = price;
            } else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = price - minPrice;
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```


**Kotlin Solution:**
```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun maxProfit(prices: IntArray): Int {
        var minPrice = Int.MAX_VALUE
        var maxProfit = 0
        
        for (price in prices) {
            if (price < minPrice) {
                minPrice = price
            } else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = price - minPrice
            }
        }
        return maxProfit
    }
}
```

**Scala Solution:**
```scala
object Solution {
    def maxProfit(prices: Array[Int]): Int = {
        var minPrice = Int.MaxValue
        var maxProfit = 0
        
        for (price <- prices) {
            if (price < minPrice) {
                minPrice = price
            } else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = price - minPrice
            }
        }
        maxProfit
    }
}
```
